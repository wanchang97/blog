description: "A summary of my winter trip to Serbia with my mom. Includes tips on free public transport, SIM cards, Belgrade accommodation, and skiing advice."
---

This winter, I traveled to Serbia with my mom for a two-week trip. We mainly focused on flexible planning as we went, hoping to explore the Balkans in two weeks, but we realized two weeks wasn't that long. To prioritize a relaxed pace, we concentrated on Serbia, adding a ski week. We spent three days in Belgrade as a base, went skiing in Kopaonik, and then returned to Belgrade to rest.

Background: We flew from Munich, Germany to Belgrade (about 1.5 hours). Round trip via Lufthansa was 270 Euros for two people.

During preparation, I preferred searching for last-minute guides online rather than browsing social media for inspiration. I needed comprehensive and detailed experience posts. [Chenhe's Blog - Serbia Skiing Guide](https://chenhe.me/zh/posts/skiing-in-serbia/) (Chinese) helped me effectively. Inspired by this, I want to add my 2026 experience to provide a reference for friends who want to travel and ski in Serbia.

# General Travel Tips for Serbia

## 🛂 Entry and Visa
**Visa-free for Chinese citizens**. The process is extremely smooth. Basically no queuing, no difficulty, just a stamp for entry. Currently, Serbia is a non-Schengen country in the Balkans, so you don't need a Schengen visa to fly directly from China.

---

## 📶 Network and SIM Cards
### Domestic Carrier International Roaming - Not Recommended
1. **Signal Issues:** Roaming signal is unstable and often degrades.
2. **"The Wall" Exists:** International roaming from China still blocks Google Maps, ChatGPT, or Gemini, which is fatal for independent travel (maps/translation).
So, it is better to connect to airport WiFi temporarily and buy a local SIM card.

### International Travel eSIM - Flexible but Slightly Expensive
Suitable for multi-country trips. Note that some Chinese phones only support dual physical SIMs and no eSIM, while US versions might be eSIM only. Please check your phone compatibility.

### Buying Local SIM/eSIM
* **Where to buy:** **Yettel**, **A1**, and other carrier counters are located at the baggage claim in the airport. Prices are transparent, no scams, and activated with your passport.
* **Packages (Feb 2026):**
    * **Serbia Only:** 
    For example, Yettel offers 100GB for 15 days (700 RSD) or 50GB for 7 days (500 RSD), suitable for tourists.
<img src="/blog/images/yettel%E6%89%8B%E6%9C%BA%E6%B5%81%E9%87%8F%E9%A2%84%E4%BB%98%E5%8D%A1%E5%A5%97%E9%A4%90.jpg" alt="Serbia Yettel SIM Card" width="50%" />
  
    * **Balkan Roaming:** If visiting Montenegro or Bosnia, you can choose 50GB (Serbia) + 8GB (Roaming) for 1400 RSD (30 days). *Note: This might require visiting a city store.*
* **Calls:** Most packages are data-only. To contact hosts, download the carrier app to top up for calls, or use WhatsApp.

---

## 🚌 Transportation

* **Airport Shuttle (A1):** Extra cost (approx. 400 RSD/person). Direct to city center. Old vehicles but very fast.
* **City Bus:** **Free from Jan 1, 2025** (including tourists). High frequency, crowded but convenient.
* **Intercity Bus:** Google Maps often fails to show intercity transit, only driving/walking routes. Dozens of private companies (Lasta, Jugoprevoz, Fudeks, etc.) operate buses and don't share real-time data with Google.
**Alternatives:**
1. [BAS Official Booking Site](https://www.bas.rs/sr/autobuske-karte)
2. [Local Bus Site (Polazak)](https://www.polazak.rs/sr/). You can book online, but for operators like Lasta, you might need to pay a platform fee (approx. 500 RSD) at the [BAS station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Belgrade+Bus+Station/@44.8081721,20.40194,4036m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sBAS!3m6!1s0x475a7aacb8ca4d5d:0x7db94704474c1529!8m2!3d44.8058417!4d20.416284!15sCgNCQVNaBSIDYmFzkgELYnVzX2NvbXBhbnmaASNDaFpEU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVTmtkbDlNZEdKQkVBReABAPoBBAgAEEQ!16s%2Fg%2F1tdkql6x?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIwMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Buying tickets on-site avoids the extra fee but totals about the same.
3. **Kopaonik Shuttle:**
Besides regular buses, many private mini-buses/shared transfers exist (Terra Travel, Gea Tours). They offer door-to-door service (Belgrade accommodation to Ski Resort). These aren't on maps; book via official websites or WhatsApp.
* **Taxi:** Use **Yandex Go** or **Pink Taxi**. Transparent pricing avoids scams.

---

## 💰 Money and Payment
Currency is Dinar (**RSD**). Euro exchange rate is stable and Euros are often accepted. However, cash is preferred, especially by homestays/Airbnbs.

* **Strategy:** **Euro Cash** + **Multi-currency Credit Card**.
* **Exchange:** ATM/Exchange machines at airport baggage claim. Transparent rates.
* **Cash Only Scenarios:** Airport shuttle, intercity bus, taxi, some Booking payments, ski rental, coach fees, small restaurants.
* **Budget:** **500 Euros** exchanged to RSD is usually enough for two people for two weeks.

# Belgrade Food and City Guide

I explored places that felt good to me personally. We wanted to experience local life, so we avoided luxury hotels/spas and chose homestays, public pools, local bakeries, and markets. We walked or took the bus instead of taxis.

#### 🏠 Accommodation Layout & Recommendations
I booked two different high-value apartments in Belgrade via Booking.

Belgrade is at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers (Ušće means confluence). The Sava River divides Belgrade into East and West.

### Belgrade Area Comparison
| Area | Features | Suitable For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Old Belgrade (East)** | Crowded but lively, like Barcelona. Close to sights, markets, malls. | Tourists who like bustle and walking. |
| **New Belgrade (West)** | Spacious, modern. Ušće Park, stadiums, many new builds. | Those who like quiet, space, or business travelers. |


## Sports and Events
#### Belgrade Arena 
European basketball matches are held irregularly.
Water polo matches are also held here (Serbia's national sport).
Official tickets: [Belgrade 2026](https://belgrade2026.rs/)
If sold out, check resale site [viagogo](https://www.viagogo.com/rs/Sports-Tickets/Basketball/Euroleague-Basketball-2025-26-Tickets?=&PCID=PSRSADWHOMEUROLHEAD7E8F7E&MetroRegionID=&psc=&ps=&ps_p=0&ps_c=21103176626&ps_ag=159535264069&ps_tg=kwd-158128261&ps_ad=790512151801&ps_adp=&ps_fi=&ps_li=&ps_lp=1028595&ps_n=g&ps_d=c&ps_ex=&pscpag=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21103176626&gbraid=0AAAAAD3dCeB1mXjf4px3rqXN0SSkA-ZaV&gclid=CjwKCAiA1obMBhAbEiwAsUBbImaaO7g30DgRp9nYwOUpq_vMteCuHyFk7pAfDE_nkmxdQXEFGJue5RoCyUoQAvD_BwE).
> **💡 Tips:** Viagogo prices often drop 7 hours before the match. You can wait to pick up a deal on the last day.

#### Tašmajdan Pool
We visited this pool. Citizen price: 600 RSD/person for 3 hours. Closed at noon, open morning and afternoon. Gym/Spa access is 2200 RSD.

Fun fact: Though it's an Olympic 50m pool, people swim across the short width, each occupying a lane back and forth.

## Culture and Performance
### JDP (Yugoslav Drama Theatre)

Check schedule at [https://www.jdp.rs/](https://www.jdp.rs/). Online tickets often sell out, but check the offline box office. Performances are innovative and authentic. Language is usually Serbian, sometimes with English subtitles. Even without understanding the language, the body language, music, and stage are immersive.

### Museums
The Contemporary Art Museum (zigzag building in Ušće Park) is free on the first Wednesday of the month.
The National Museum of Serbia is free on Sundays.

## Food Recommendations

#### Markets (Pijaca), Fish Markets, and Bakeries

##### Markets
Kalenić Green Market (Kalenić Pijaca)

##### Fish Markets
Zemun Farmers Market (Zemunska Pijaca)
![Fish Market](/blog/images/鱼市2.jpg)

##### Bakeries (Pekara)
Fresh bread from any corner bakery is the best. Recommended: **Đevrek** (Ђеврек), a sesame bagel similar to Turkish Simit.

#### Local Serbian Cuisine

**Iva New Balkan Cuisine** (Michelin Recommended): Innovative local dishes (meats, dairy). Moderate price. Book at least a day in advance.
**Langouste** (Michelin One Star): Requires reservation. No-show fee 3000 RSD. [Website](https://langouste.rs/index.php/en/)

#### Zemun River Fish Restaurants
**Šaran** (Century-old shop): [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D0%A8%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD/@44.848099,20.4027304,2023m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x475a65ac3af50113:0x73a1d3a3253f267a!8m2!3d44.8480995!4d20.4130087!16s%2Fg%2F1tcwvhtc?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIwMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Pricey but great taste (fish soup, whole fish). Recommends fresh catch from the Danube.
![Old Shop Fish](/blog/images/百年老店的鱼.jpg)


**Fish Butik**: [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fish+Butik/@44.8367162,20.4002922,2024m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x475a65110c0a553b:0x7207dd371ecf9831!8m2!3d44.8367167!4d20.4105705!16s%2Fg%2F11ngpkshfy?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIwMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Cook-to-order takeaway. Good prices, popular with locals. Menu in Serbian, ordered via photos/translation.
Fish options: Carp, Catfish, Trout, Perch.
Cooking: Grilled or Fried.
Sides: Salad or Potato.
**Cash Only.** If eating there, the owner borrows forks from next door.


#### Chinese Food
We randomly tried a few Chinese places and they were unexpectedly professional and delicious. Dumplings, Rougamo, cold noodles, ramen, hotpot, Malatang are available.

# Kopaonik Skiing Practical Advice

My advice is suitable for beginners. We didn't explore the whole mountain, mainly the beginner conveyor belts. Only went up the mountain twice with a coach and once for night skiing.
My mom (skis) and I (snowboard) are timid first-timers. We learned some lessons the hard way.

## Insurance
We want peace of mind. Suggest two types: [Travel Insurance](#travel-insurance) and [Ski Insurance](#ski-insurance).

### Travel Insurance
Hard for us: Mom came to Germany with Schengen insurance, which doesn't cover travel to Serbia (non-Schengen) for non-residents.
With Gemini's help, we found **Heymondo**, which covers travelers "already abroad". Requires 72h wait after purchase. Ideally, buy global travel insurance from China before departure.
For EU residents, annual travel insurance (e.g., Europe Assistance via Check24) is cost-effective.

### Ski Insurance
Usually included in the Ski Pass for the day. Local coverage is direct and reliable.
Frequent skiers in EU can buy [DSV (Deutsche Ski Verein)](https://www.ski-online.de/home.html). Covers global skiing risks, equipment damage/loss, and third-party liability.
Rental shops might charge extra for insurance. DSV covers this.

## Accommodation, Transport, and Rental

Plan these based on your skill level.
If staying in a town for value, you need to drive/bus, so rent lockers at the ski center.

### Accommodation
**Beginners:** Stay near **Ski Center Kopaonik** for ski-in ski-out. Beginner belts are here. Hotel **Gorski** (4-star) is famous. Homestays nearby are cheaper and have kitchen/laundry. Maxi and Idea supermarkets make life easy.
[InfoKop](https://www.infokop.net/) has all info (weather, prices, last-minute deals - Serbian only for deals, but English for lifts/slopes).

### Transport
Taxi, Ski Bus, Self-drive, Gondola.
Taxi: Pricey, potential scams.
Ski Bus: Hourly, cash only.
Gondola: Runs continuously during day.

**Experts:** Can stay in nearby villages (Brzeće, Vikend Naselje) and take T-bar/lifts up. See [Chenhe's Blog](https://chenhe.me/zh/posts/skiing-in-serbia/).
**Beginners:** Don't stress yourself. Stick to Ski Center. If staying in Brzeće, the new Gondola is convenient but stops at 16:00 (then you need the bus).

### Equipment Rental
Recommended: **Mašinac Resort** (accommodation + restaurant). Next to Green Slope 22. Youth hostel vibe. Cheap prices: Ski 800 RSD, Snowboard 1000 RSD, Helmet/Goggles 200 RSD.
![Hostel Prices](/blog/images/青旅餐厅价格.JPEG)

Shops down the mountain are more expensive.
![Rental Shop Prices](/blog/images/雪具店价格.jpg)

Cheap places might have lower quality gear. Coaches there (mostly unlicensed) are cheap (30 Euro/hr) and might offer discounted ski passes (illegal/risky without insurance).
For quality gear, ask a certified coach.

> **💡 Tips:** Slope 22 is green but requires a button lift (platter pull). Beginners might struggle. We had to carry gear halfway up.

## Ski Pass and Coaches
Buy online at [InfoKop](https://www.infokop.net/) or [Official Shop](https://shop.skipas.rs/en/) for ~5% discount.
Types: Beginner (single use), Half-day, Full-day, Night, Multi-day.
Night skiing: Slope 7 (Blue, good quality, music).
Beginner slopes at Ski Center have magic carpets.
Coach prices: ~45 Euro/hr. Discounts if renting their equipment as well.

The figure with green circle shows the beginner slope for snowboarding.
![Beginner Slope](/blog/images/初学者道.jpg)

Advice: Buy beginner tickets first, then upgrade according to your need.

## Relaxing: Spa & Wellness
We tried **Gorski Hotel** Spa. 3900 RSD/person (morning). Pay at B3. Pool/Hot spring okay, Saunas good, Water bed room interesting.

Gorski B1 has an Italian Fine Dining restaurant. Good portions, fancy desserts (dry ice rose).
